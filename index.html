    <h1>POLLUTION</h1>

    <h2>1.Air pollution</h2>
<div class="ok">
    <p>Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the
    health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
    There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (such as ammonia, carbon
     monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons),
      particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause
       diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms
        such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate 
        change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).
         Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution. </p>

         <p>Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases,
              including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.[1]
               The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect 
               the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions 
               to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree
                of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.[2] Indoor air
                 pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic
                  pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places
                   report.[3] Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1[4][5] to 4.21 million deaths 
                   annually.[1][6] Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million 
                   people worldwide each year, and is the world's largest single environmental
                    health risk.[1][7][8] The scope of the air pollution crisis is enormous: 90% 
                    of the world's population breathes dirty air to some degree. Although the health 
                    consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is often haphazard.</p>

               <h2>2.Water pollution</h2></div> 
                <div class="no">
                <p>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, usually
                     as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers,
                     oceans, aquifers and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are 
                     introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated
                      wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems.
                       In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They
                        may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water
                         pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.[1]</p>

                         <p>Water pollution can be classified as surface water or groundwater pollution. Marine pollution
                             and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either
                              point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution,
                             such as a storm drain or a wastewater treatment plant. Non-point sources are more diffuse,
                            such as agricultural runoff.[2] Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time.
                             All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted.
                             The effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological communities
                             they are part of.</p>
                             
                             <p>The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters.
                                  Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted
                                   water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial 
                                   manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain
                                    composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species.[3][4]:37</p>
